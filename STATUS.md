## 🎉 What v3.0.2 Delivered

### Termux Detection System
- **New:** `AndroidPackageDetector` utility for reliable app detection
- Uses `pm list packages` (Android package manager) - no root required
- Detects: Termux, Termux:API, Termux:Float, Termux:Widget, Termux:Boot
- Provides: version info, install source, timestamps, enablement status

### Prerequisite Checker
- **New:** `TermuxPrerequisiteChecker` validates installation readiness
- Checks: Android platform, Termux installation, storage permissions
- Validates: Node.js availability, network connectivity, storage space (500MB+)
- Returns: Detailed blocking issues with actionable fixes, recommendations

### Enhanced Installer UX
- Pre-installation readiness check runs automatically
- Visual readiness card with pass/fail indicators
- Clear blocking issues with specific action items
- Recommendations for optional improvements
- Real-time Termux environment detection display
- Prevents installation when blocking issues exist

### Technical Improvements
- **New file:** `lib/utils/android_package_detector.dart` (400+ lines)
- **Updated:** `lib/services/termux_service.dart` (enhanced detection)
- **Updated:** `lib/services/nodejs_installer_service.dart` (prerequisite integration)
- **Updated:** `lib/screens/local_installer_screen.dart` (UX overhaul)

## 🔧 What v3.0.1 Fixed (Previous Release)

### Chat routing / send-button confusion
The main bug was not the send icon itself — it was that several navigation paths opened `ChatScreen` **without** a `GatewayService`, so chat had no backend to talk to.

Fixed wiring in:
- `DashboardScreen`
- `QuickActionsScreen`
- `GlobalSearchScreen`
- Actions hub in `lib/app.dart`

### Additional fix
- Dashboard memory percentage now avoids divide-by-zero / invalid calculation behavior.

## 🧪 Validation

### Passed
```bash
flutter test                          # ✅ 2/2 tests passed
flutter build apk --debug             # ✅ Success (100.7MB)
flutter build apk --release           # ✅ Success (100.7MB)
```

### Analysis
- Targeted static analysis: No blocking errors
- Info-level warnings only (deprecation notices, style suggestions)

## 📋 Remaining Work

### Medium priority
- Validate chat end-to-end against a live OpenClaw gateway session
- Clean up remaining analyzer warnings (deprecation notices)
- Expand tests around chat/session routing
- Add unit tests for AndroidPackageDetector
- Decide whether to keep two project folders long-term or consolidate

### Low priority
- Custom fonts (OpenClaw-Bold, OpenClaw-Regular)
- Placeholder assets replacement
- Additional animations

---

## 🗂️ Working Rule

Until consolidation is done:
- **Primary edit location:** `Android-App-DuckBot`
- **Secondary synced copy:** `DuckBot-Go-Project`
